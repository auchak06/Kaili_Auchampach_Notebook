1. Create a new Benchling file with your gene of interest and about 2kB on either side
2. Go approximately 1kB upstream from the beginning of your gene
    * Take into consideration the direction of your gene
3. Find a section that is relatively G-C rich
4. Highlight until the melting temp is around 57-60˚C
5. Go to IDT's OligoAnalyzer tool https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer
6. Copy chosen DNA sequence (forward, not reverse) into IDT and Analyze
    * Under Results section, the melt temp should be about 60˚C (+/- 3˚C)
