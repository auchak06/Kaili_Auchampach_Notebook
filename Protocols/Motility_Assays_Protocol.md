### Motility Assay
#### Stab Motility Assay
* Day 1: Make TBS plates for streaking
  * Streaking TBS plate recipe (per liter)
    * 10 g tryptone
    * 20 g NaCl
    * 50 mL 1M Tris buffer (pH 7.5)
    * 15 g agar (1.5%)
    * 950 mL dH2O
  * Autoclave in p14 cycle and pour plates
  * Let plates solidify overnight on benchtop
* Day 2: streak plates and make motility plates
  * Streak each isolate onto TBS 1.5% agar plates
    * Incubate overnight at 25˚C
  * Make TBS motility plates
    * Same TBS recipe as above but use only 3 g agar for 0.3% agar
    * Use serological pipette to put 40 mL of TBS per Omnitray
      * Put TBS on a plate with lowest stir setting and 55˚C while pipetting
      * Can do up to 8 spots per plate so plan accordingly (Have only used 6 spots so far)
    * Let solidify overnight under a container with a petri dish of water to prevent evaporation
* Day 3: poke colonies from streak plates and stab in motility plates
  * Pick at least 3 colonies per strain to get technical replicates
    * Pick using a p10 pipette tip and stab to bottom of Omnitray
  * Incubate for 5 hrs in 25˚C and photograph
    * Can check and photograph every hour after hour 2 to measure motility over time (did not here)
* Analyze in ImageJ to measure migration
  * Set scale using ruler lines to 10 mm
  * Measure diameter of spots from edge to edge of visible halo (edited)
