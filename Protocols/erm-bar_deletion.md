#### Protocol summarized from Avery's notebook
### Generate US-LL and DS-RL
* Extract parent strain gDNA from 700 ul of overnight culture of "V. fischeri"
  * Incubate strains at 25ËšC in 3 mL LBS overnight
  * Extract and purify DNA with DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and quantify
* Generate homology arms
  * Thaw 10 uM of primers F1+R1, F2+R2 for each deletion
  * Set up 3x reactions for 25 uL volume per reaction PCRs for both hology arms of each deletion
