## 96-Well Plate Luminescence Assay
### Day 1:
* Make 150 mM NaCl SWTO media as described in [Bose JL, Kim U, Bartkowski W, Gunsalus RP, Overley AM, Lyell NL, et al. Bioluminescence in Vibrio fischeri is controlled by the redox-responsive regulator ArcA. Mol Microbiol. 2007;65: 538–553.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05809.x)
  * Recipe:
    * 5 grams Bacto-Tryptone
    * 3 grams Bacto Yeast Extract
    * 6 mL 50% glycerol
    * 700 mL IO
    * 8.766 grams NaCl
    * Fill to 1000 mL with dI H20
### Day 2:
* Inoculate strains and incubate liquid LBS overnights (n = 6) at 25˚C on rotator
### Day 3:
* Measure luminescence and OD600 for each strain in plate reader in triplicate
  * Sterilize black clear-bottom 96-well plate under UV light in sterile hood for at least 20 minutes, then put sterile lid on.
  * In sterile black clear-bottom 96-well plate, create a 1:1000 dilution in triplicate for each strain (20ml culture into 180 ml STWO; 2ml mixture into 198 STWO). Create a checkerboard pattern of strains to minimize luminescence interference between wells.
  * Plate protocol: every 30 minutes for 24 hours: shake plate for 10 seconds, measure luminescence (RLU-100), shake plate for 10 seconds, measure luminescence (RLU-150), shake plate for 10 seconds, measure OD600.
  * Data and analysis found in:
* Analysis:
  * Plot specific luminescence as Blank RLU-100 divided by Blank OD600
