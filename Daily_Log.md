#### Daily notes to keep track of progress and keep self organized
Before 3/18/24:
  * Have been working with Anna Dickfoss to create an ErmBAR deletion of the motility gene (flora) in _V. Fischeri_
      * So far have successfully replaced the motility gene with the ErmBAR using Hector Burgos deletion protocol
      * Currently doing transformation to incorporate ErmBAR back into genomic sequence
   
3/21/24:
 * Checked DNA by running a gel so it can be sent in for sequencing
    * PCR was unsuccessful so I restreaked the samples on Erm 5 plates and LBS plates and I made new overnight cultures in Erm 5 broth
 * Plating squid for Avery: Group M3 5.1-5.4, 4.1-4.5

4/9/24:
 * Checked DNA again by running gel to be sent for sequencing
 * PCR was successful

4/11/24:
 * DNA was sent for sequencing
 * Realized that the incorrect
