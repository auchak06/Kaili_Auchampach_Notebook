5/8/24
* Counted Avery Squid
     * E. scolopes monocolonization w/ berryi strains (ES1) Exp 1; Groups 1-4
* Plated Avery squid
     * E. berryi noncolonizing mutants M1 and M2; Plated groups (M1): 1-5 and Groups (M2): 2
     * E. scolopes monocolonization w/ berryi strains (ES1) Exp 1; Plated groups 5 and Apo
* Day 2 of luminescence assay procotol

5/7/24
* Plated squid for Avery
     * E. scolopes monocolonization w/ berryi strains (ES1) Exp 1; Plated groups 1-4
 
4/20/24
* Motility assay day 3
     * Spot strains (streaks didn't grow very well, very small colonies)
     * Incubate 5 hours (halos didn't grow as expected; no halo for 1100)
     * Photograph w/ ruler in frame (camera was not working, couldn't get good pictures, very blurry; took backup photos on phone)
     * Analyze on FIJI

4/19/24
* Collected luminescence data
* Day 2 of motility assay
     * Streaked strains on TBS plates: MJM1100, MJM1117, MJM1130, MJM1318, MJM2110, MJM3792
     * Poured omnitrays (40ml in each) w/ 3% agar

4/18/24
* Day 2 of luminescence assay
     * Same exact steps as previous day as well as identical grid pattern
* Day 1 of spot motility assay
     * Poured 15% agar TBS plates

4/17/24:
* Day 2 of luminescence assay
     * Sterilized black 96-well plate under UV (20 minutes)
     * Diluted 1:10 (culture:SWTO) into microtubes for each strain
     * Diluted 1:100 (culture:SWTO) into 96-well plate in grid pattern (total dilution = 1:1000)
     * Grid pattern:

* Day 1 of luminescence assay: Inoculte and incubated 6 strains in liquid LBS overnight
     * MJM1100, MJM1117, MJM1130, MJM1318, MJM2110, MJM3792
 
4/16/24:
* Day 1 of luminescence assay: Inoculate and incubated 6 strains in liquid LBS overnight
     * MJM1100, MJM1117, MJM1130, MJM1318, MJM2110, MJM3792

4/11/24:
 * Nanodropped samples:
     * crcS 1: 260/280: 1.82; 260/230: 1.85; ng/μL: 68.0
     * crcS 2: 260/280: 1.94; 260/230: 2.50; ng/μL: 56.6
 * DNA was sent for sequencing
 * Realized we have been using the incorrect primers and have been doing a biofilm deletion instead of a motility deletion. Might have also been using the wrong parent bacteria.

4/9/24:
 * Checked DNA again by running gel so it can be sent for sequencing
      * PCR was successful

3/21/24:
 * Checked DNA by running a gel so it can be sent in for sequencing
    * PCR was unsuccessful so I restreaked the samples on Erm 5 plates and LBS plates and I made new overnight cultures in Erm 5 broth
 * Plating squid for Avery: Group M3 5.1-5.4, 4.1-4.5

Before 3/18/24:
  * Have been working with Anna Dickfoss to create an ErmBAR deletion of the motility gene (flrA) in _V. Fischeri_
      * So far have successfully replaced the motility gene with the ErmBAR using Hector Burgos deletion protocol
      * Currently doing transformation to incorporate ErmBAR back into genomic sequence
