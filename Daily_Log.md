#### Daily notes to keep track of progress and keep self organized
4/11/24:
 * Nanodropped samples:
     * crcS 1: 260/280: 1.82; 260/230: 1.85; ng/μL: 68.0
     * crcS 2: 260/280: 1.94; 260/230: 2.50; ng/μL: 56.6
 * DNA was sent for sequencing
 * Realized we have been using the incorrect primers and have been doing a biofilm deletion instead of a motility deletion. Might have also been using the wrong parent bacteria.

4/9/24:
 * Checked DNA again by running gel so it can be sent for sequencing
      * PCR was successful

3/21/24:
 * Checked DNA by running a gel so it can be sent in for sequencing
    * PCR was unsuccessful so I restreaked the samples on Erm 5 plates and LBS plates and I made new overnight cultures in Erm 5 broth
 * Plating squid for Avery: Group M3 5.1-5.4, 4.1-4.5

Before 3/18/24:
  * Have been working with Anna Dickfoss to create an ErmBAR deletion of the motility gene (flrA) in _V. Fischeri_
      * So far have successfully replaced the motility gene with the ErmBAR using Hector Burgos deletion protocol
      * Currently doing transformation to incorporate ErmBAR back into genomic sequence
